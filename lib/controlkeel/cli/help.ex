    What CK can do:
      - bootstrap a governed project with local MCP access
      - attach supported coding hosts such as Codex, Claude, Cursor, OpenCode, and more
      - surface findings, plan reviews, proofs, and release-readiness checks
      - run or hand off governed tasks through supported agent execution paths
      - export native bundles, plugins, and hosted MCP/A2A access surfaces

    Good starting points:
      - `controlkeel help getting-started`
      - `controlkeel help attach`
      - `controlkeel help codex`
      - `controlkeel help why is my task blocked`
      - `controlkeel help run agents`
      - `controlkeel help providers`
      - `controlkeel help troubleshooting`

    Common first commands:
      - `controlkeel init`
      - `controlkeel attach codex-cli`
      - `controlkeel attach doctor`
      - `controlkeel status`
