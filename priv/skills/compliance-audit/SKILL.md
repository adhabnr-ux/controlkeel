description: "DEPRECATED — use `security-review` instead (it now covers all of this — regulated flows, policy packs, domain controls). Kept as a thin alias for search (compliance/GDPR/SOC2/HIPAA) so existing `ck_skill_list` queries still surface `security-review`."
when_to_use: "Do NOT invoke this skill directly — invoke `security-review`, which runs the compliance audit as its policy/domain-pack layer. This file exists only so keyword search for compliance, GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA routes to the consolidated `security-review` path."

# Compliance Audit Skill — alias

> **This skill has moved.** Use `security-review` — it runs the same compliance audit
> as its policy/domain-pack layer (active compliance profile → pack sections →
> `ck_validate` → `ck_finding`). This file is a thin keyword alias so search for
> `compliance`, `GDPR`, `SOC2`, `HIPAA` still surfaces the consolidated path.
