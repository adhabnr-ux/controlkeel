# Challenge Skill

Adversarially review the current plan or a specific finding. The goal is not to block work — it is to surface the strongest objections *before* execution so they can be addressed, not discovered mid-implementation.

Inspired by Paradigma/Flywheel's adversarial review nodes: every knowledge claim should have an adversarial pass that tries to refute it before it propagates downstream.

## When to Use

- Before executing a plan with `architectural_scope: true` or `depth >= 5`
- When the user asks "what could go wrong", "push back on this", or "devil's advocate"
- After `ck_review_submit` on a plan that affects multiple files or core modules
- When a finding has been open for multiple sessions and no one has questioned it
- Before delegating long-running autonomous work

## Challenge Flow

### Step 1 — Load context

Call `ck_context` to load:
- The current session, task, and latest approved plan
- Open findings (especially `blocked` and `escalated`)
- Risk tier and compliance constraints

If a specific `review_id` or `rule_id` was passed as an argument, use that as the target. Otherwise challenge the latest approved plan from `planning_context.latest_approved_plan`.

### Step 2 — Extract the hypothesis

Look for `hypothesis` and `expected_signal` in the plan refinement. If absent, infer them:
- **Hypothesis**: what core assumption does this plan rest on? (e.g. "adding X will fix Y", "this abstraction won't break Z")
- **Expected signal**: what would confirm the hypothesis is correct?

State both explicitly before challenging. If you cannot reconstruct a hypothesis, that itself is the first challenge: **"This plan has no falsifiable hypothesis."**

### Step 3 — Run the adversarial pass

For each dimension below, generate the strongest objection you can. Do not hedge — argue as if you are trying to kill the plan.

#### A. Assumption inversion
List the top 3 assumptions the plan makes. For each, ask: "What if this is false?" If any assumption being false would make the plan fail or significantly change the approach, flag it.

#### B. Scope creep signal
Look at `scope_estimate`. Is `architectural_scope` underreported? Are there more files likely to be touched than `files_touched_estimate` suggests? Flag any evidence that the real diff will be larger than claimed.

#### C. Contradicted findings
Check existing findings. Does any open finding (status `open` or `blocked`) directly contradict or undermine the plan? List them with their `rule_id`.

#### D. Missing alternatives
Look at `options_considered` and `rejected_options`. Is there a viable approach that was never considered? Describe it in one sentence and state why it might be better.

#### E. Validation gap
Look at `validation_plan`. Is there a scenario where all validation steps pass but the plan still fails in production? Describe it.

#### F. Hallucination propagation risk
If this plan produces outputs that downstream tasks will depend on — identify what those outputs are and whether they are verifiable. Flag any output that downstream work will treat as ground truth but that has not been independently verified.

### Step 4 — Score the challenge

Summarize findings as:

```
STRONG objections (would change the plan):   N
MODERATE objections (should be addressed):   N
WEAK objections (worth noting, not blocking): N
```

If `STRONG >= 1`: recommend **blocking execution** and re-submitting the plan with the objections addressed.
If `STRONG == 0, MODERATE >= 2`: recommend **addressing before execution starts**, not blocking.
If `STRONG == 0, MODERATE <= 1`: recommend **proceeding** with the noted caveats.

### Step 5 — Record findings

For each STRONG or MODERATE objection, call `ck_finding` with:
- `category`: `"challenge"`
- `severity`: `"high"` for STRONG, `"medium"` for MODERATE
- `rule_id`: `"challenge.<dimension>"` (e.g. `"challenge.assumption_inversion"`, `"challenge.validation_gap"`)
- `plain_message`: the objection in one sentence
- `decision`: `"warn"` (never block automatically — the human decides)
- `extends_finding_id`: the finding this challenge responds to, if applicable
- `contradicts_finding_id`: any existing finding this objection overturns, if applicable

Do NOT record WEAK objections as findings. Include them only in the report.

### Step 6 — Output the report

```markdown
# Challenge Report

**Target:** [plan title or finding rule_id]
**Hypothesis:** [stated or inferred]
**Expected signal:** [stated or inferred, or "not specified"]

## Verdict: [BLOCK | ADDRESS BEFORE EXECUTION | PROCEED WITH CAVEATS]

## Strong objections
[list, or "None"]

## Moderate objections
[list, or "None"]

## Weak objections / notes
[list, or "None"]

## Findings recorded
[list of ck_finding IDs created, or "None"]
```

## Integration with ck_review_submit

After a challenge that clears (no STRONG objections), the caller can re-submit the plan with the moderate objections addressed. The new submission should include:
- `hypothesis`: the hypothesis now made explicit
- `expected_signal`: the observable confirmation criterion
- Prior challenge findings referenced in `alignment_context`

This creates a traceable chain: plan → challenge → revised plan → execution.

## What this skill does NOT do

- It does not rewrite or fix the plan. It challenges it.
- It does not block execution directly. It records findings and gives a recommendation.
- It does not repeat static policy checks (`ck_validate` covers those). It targets reasoning and assumption errors.
