description: "DEPRECATED — use `security-review` instead (it now covers all domain-pack audits — HR, legal, marketing, sales, real-estate, government, insurance, logistics, manufacturing, e-commerce, nonprofit). Kept as a thin alias so `ck_skill_list` for those domains still surfaces `security-review`."
when_to_use: "Do NOT invoke this skill directly — invoke `security-review`, which runs the domain-pack audit as its policy/domain-pack layer. This file exists only so keyword search for HR, legal, marketing, sales, government, etc. routes to the consolidated `security-review` path."

# Domain Audit Skill — alias

> **This skill has moved.** Use `security-review` — it runs the same domain-pack
> audit as its policy/domain-pack layer. This file is a thin keyword alias so
> search for `HR`, `legal`, `marketing`, `sales`, `government`, `insurance`,
> `logistics`, `manufacturing`, `e-commerce`, or `nonprofit` still surfaces
> the consolidated path.
