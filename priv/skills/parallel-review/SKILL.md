# Parallel Review

Run `security-review` and `deep-code-quality-review` concurrently, synthesize into one prioritized report.

## Do NOT use when
- Only security OR quality review needed (use the specific skill directly)
- During normal coding
- For single-file changes where sequential review is fast enough

## Workflow

1. Run `ck_git_diff` to gather the diff. Run `ck_validate` for automated findings.
2. Launch both reviews (via `ck_delegate` or sequential invocation):
   - **Security**: `security-review` skill — OWASP, injection, auth, secrets, deps
   - **Quality**: `deep-code-quality-review` skill — abstraction, file size, spaghetti, layering
   Both record findings independently via `ck_finding`.
3. Synthesize:
   - Deduplicate: same code path flagged by both → one finding, higher severity
   - Prioritize: critical > high > medium > low; security > quality > reviewability
   - Weight overlaps: flagged by both = higher confidence
   - Resolve disagreements with your own judgment
4. Submit via `ck_review_submit` (review_type: `diff`) with combined findings.
5. **Wait for approval** before merge/deploy.

## Rules

- Both reviews must complete — do not skip one
- Blocked finding from either = merge blocked
- Deduplicate, do not double-count

## Output

- Combined findings (deduplicated, prioritized)
- `ck_review_submit` diff review
- Clear verdict: merge / merge with warnings / blocked
